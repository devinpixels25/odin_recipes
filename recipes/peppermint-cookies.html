    <h2>Cookies with peppermint!</h2>

    <p>The traditional way to bake cookies is used, except we have some peppermint baked chips. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="center-me">
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) salted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla powder (you can also use vanilla extract or vanilla paste)</li>
        <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Peppermint baking chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol class="center-me">
        <li>Preheat oven to 350F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter and sugar together with vanilla until well combined. Be sure to scrape down the bowl as necessary to get everything evenly incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add the flour (if using a stand mixer turn the mixer down to low) and peppermint chips and blend until there is no dry flour left and the dough starts to come together in large clumps.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and bring together with your hands so it is relatively smooth. Pat into a flat disk and wrap in plastic wrap. I smooth out the wrapped dough with my hands, over the plastic wrap, to get it nice and smooth. Chill for at least an hour, or up to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Roll out the dough to 1/4 inch on a lightly floured surface. Note: if the dough is cold let it sit for a bit until it softens enough to roll. I like to lay a sheet of plastic wrap over the dough while I roll to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Cut out your cookies and place on your parchment lined baking sheets. Bake for 10 -12 minutes, depending on how thick they are. Shortbread will still be pale when done. If you like your shortbread more on the crunchy side you can bake longer. I suggest doing a test cookie or two to determine the baking time that is best for you and your cookies.</li>
        <li>Allow your baked shortbread cookies to cool completely on the baking sheet before transferring them. Shortbread is delicate when hot and can break easily. Cooling on the sheet allows them to firm up slightly, making them easier to handle.</li>
        <li>Store your cooled cookies at room temperature in an airtight container or wrapped in foil. Freeze cookies for longer storage in an airtight container or heavy duty freezer bag with layers separated by sheets of parchment or waxed paper. Force any air out before zipping closed.
        </li>
    </ol>
